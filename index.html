            <h2>Reason for applying to the program : </h2>
            <p class="two">
                I have been interested in programming for a long time, and I loved the way it works and how it converts
                numbers and letters into images, pages and programs that are valuable and effective, and my English is
                excellent, and a way to solve problems and be patient with them. I want to take advantage of these
                features and be a creative programmer.<br>
                I want to join with you in a participatory environment to get to know new colleagues and teachers,
                through whom I gain knowledge and motivation to continue, and finally, I applied with you on this same
                program last time and completed all the technical steps, but unfortunately I was not accepted. I hope
                this time to have a share with you.<br><br>

                After completing the program, I will know programming in general and broadly, what are its languages and
                how to use them. I want to develop myself in a specific field that is important to be a creative
                programmer in my work,
                And also employ programming in the field studied by business administration.
                My dream is to reach the stage of creativity in programming and build important sites and programs for
                youth and society to earn money, knowledge and work through freelance sites. I want to spread the idea
                of programming through social media platforms and to be a teacher and motivator for my youth peers and
                society
